# `feepay`

## Abstract

This document specifies the internal `x/feepay` module of Juno Network.

The `x/feepay` module provides functionality for Smart Contract developers to cover the execution fees of transactions interacting with their contract. This aims to improve the user experience and help onboard wallets with little to no available funds. Developers can setup their contract with FeePay by first registering it and then funding it with Juno.
