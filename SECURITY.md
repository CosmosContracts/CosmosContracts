# Juno bug reporting and feature requests

The Juno core development team uses GitHub to manage feature requests and bugs. This is done via GitHub Issues.

## Triage and progress 🔜

Issues added to GitHub will be triaged as they come in.

Tracking of in-flight issues will be done through the Juno Core project board, but of course we reserve the right to not make a public issue if there is a security implication in doing so.

## Feature request 🚀

For a feature request, e.g. module inclusion, please make a GitHub issue. Clearly state your use case and what value it will bring to other users or developers on Juno.

If it is something that can be handled by a param change, discuss it on Discord in the `#governance` channel, and consider a governance proposal.

## Standard priority bug 🐛

For a bug that is non-sensitive and/or operational in nature rather than a critical vulnerability, please add it as a GitHub issue.

If it is not triaged in a couple of days, feel free to tag `@the-frey` or `@jakehartnell`.

## Critical bug or security issue 💥

For a critical security bug, please do not publicly disclose it, or post on GitHub. Instead, go to [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHdzjS5vXx), and alert the core engineers:

- Jake (Meow) `Meow Stargaze ✨🔭#1736`
- Dimi `dimi 🦙#2998`
- Alex (the-frey) `the-frey#8626`
- Ben2x4 `Ben2x4#4071`
- Jacob `jacobgadikian#9883`
- Giansalex `giansalex#1825`
